# Chapter 5. Orchestration

Now that your agent has a set of tools that can be used, it’s time to
orchestrate them to solve real tasks. Orchestration involves more than just
deciding which tools to call and when—it also requires constructing the right
context for each model invocation to ensure effective, grounded actions. While
simple tasks may only need a single tool and minimal context, more complex
workflows demand careful planning, memory retrieval, and dynamic context
assembly to perform each step accurately. In this chapter, we’ll cover
orchestration strategies, context engineering, tool selection, execution, and
planning topologies to build agents capable of handling realistic, multistep
tasks efficiently and reliably. As we can see in
[Figure 5-1](#chapter_5_figure_1_1754586822709705), orchestration is how the
system utilizes the resources at its disposal to address the user query
effectively.

###### Figure 5-1. Orchestration as the core logic that handles user queries and coordinates calls to the foundation models, external and local tools, and to various databases to retrieve additional information.

# Agent Types

Before diving into specific orchestration strategies, it’s important to
understand the different types of agents you can build. Each agent type embodies
a distinct approach to reasoning, planning, and action, shaping how tasks are
decomposed and executed. Some agents respond instantly with preprogrammed
mappings, while others iteratively reason and reflect to handle complex,
open-ended goals. The choice of agent type directly influences your system’s
performance, cost, and capabilities. In this section, we will explore the
spectrum: from reflex agents that provide lightning-fast responses, to deep
research agents that tackle multistage investigations with adaptive plans and
synthesis. Understanding these archetypes will help design agents aligned with
your application needs and constraints and will illuminate how orchestration
patterns, tool selection, and context construction come together within each
type to achieve effective, reliable outcomes.

## Reflex Agents

Reflex agents implement a direct mapping from input to action without any
internal reasoning trace. Simple reflex agents follow “if-condition,
then-action” rules, calling the appropriate tool immediately upon detecting
predefined triggers. Because they bypass intermediate thought steps, reflex
agents deliver responses with minimal latency and predictable performance,
making them well suited for use cases like keyword-based routing, single-step
data lookups, or basic automations (e.g., “If X, call tool Y”). However, their
limited expressiveness means they cannot handle tasks requiring multistep
reasoning or context beyond the immediate input.

## ReAct Agents

ReAct agents interleave Reasoning and Action in an iterative loop: the model
generates a *thought*, selects and invokes a tool, observes the result, and
repeats as needed. This pattern enables the agent to break complex tasks into
manageable steps, updating its plan based on intermediate observations:

* `ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION` (LangChain) presents tools and instructions in a
  single prompt, relying on the LLM’s innate reasoning to select and call tools
  without example traces.
* `CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION` extends this by incorporating conversational
  history, enabling the agent to use past exchanges when deciding on its next
  action.

ReAct agents excel in exploratory scenarios—dynamic data analysis, multisource
aggregation, or troubleshooting—where the ability to adapt midstream outweighs
the additional latency and computational overhead. Their looped structure also
provides transparency (“chain of thought”) that aids debugging and auditability,
though it can increase API costs and response times.

## Planner-Executor Agents

Planner-executor agents split a task into two distinct phases: planning, where
the model generates a multistep plan; and execution, where each planned step is
carried out via tool calls. This clear separation lets the planner focus on
long-horizon reasoning while executors invoke only the necessary tools, reducing
redundant LLM calls. Because the plan is explicit, debugging and monitoring
become straightforward—you can inspect the generated plan, track which step
failed, and replan if needed. This approach has multiple advantages:

Clear decomposition
:   Complex tasks break down into manageable subtasks.

Debuggability
:   Explicit plans reveal where and why errors occur.

Cost efficiency
:   Smaller models or fewer LLM calls handle execution, reserving large models for
    planning.

## Query-Decomposition Agents

Query-decomposition agents tackle a complex question by iteratively breaking it
into subquestions, invoking search or other tools for each, and then
synthesizing a final answer. This pattern—often called “self-ask with
search”—prompts the model: “What follow-up question do I need?” → call search →
“What’s the next question?” → … → “What’s the final answer?”

* Example: `SELF_ASK_WITH_SEARCH`
* Ask: “Who lived longer, X or Y?”
* Self-ask: “What’s X’s lifespan?” → search tool
* Self-ask: “What’s Y’s lifespan?” → search tool
* Synthesize: “X lived 85 years, Y lived 90 years, so Y lived longer”

This approach excels when external knowledge retrieval is needed, ensuring each
fact is grounded in tool output before composing the final response.

## Reflection Agents

Reflection and metareasoning agents extend the ReAct paradigm by not only
interleaving thought and action but also reviewing past steps to identify and
correct mistakes before proceeding. In this approach—exemplified by the recently
proposed ReflAct framework—the agent continuously grounds its reasoning in
goal-state reflections, measuring its current state against the intended outcome
and adjusting its plan when misalignments arise. Reflection prompts encourage
the model to critique its own chain of thought, correct logical errors, and
reinforce successful strategies, effectively simulating human-style
self-assessment during complex problem-solving.

This pattern shines in high-stakes workflows where early errors can cascade into
costly failures—such as financial transaction orchestration, medical diagnosis
support, or critical incident response. By pairing each action with a reflection
step, agents detect when tool outputs deviate from expectations and can replan
or roll back before committing to irreversible operations. The added
metareasoning overhead does incur extra latency and compute, but for tasks where
correctness and reliability outweigh speed, reflection agents offer a powerful
guardrail against error propagation and help maintain alignment with overarching
goals.

## Deep Research Agents

Deep research agents specialize in tackling open-ended, highly complex
investigations that require extensive external knowledge gathering, hypothesis
testing, and synthesis—think literature reviews, scientific discovery, or
strategic market analysis. They combine multiple patterns: a planner-executor
phase to chart research workflows; query-decomposition to break down big
questions into targeted searches; and ReAct loops to iteratively refine
hypotheses based on new findings. In a typical cycle, a deep research agent
will:

1. Plan the overall research agenda (e.g., identify key subtopics or data sources).
2. Decompose each subtopic into concrete queries (via `SELF_ASK` or similar).
3. Invoke tools—from academic search APIs to domain-specific databases—and reflect
   on the relevance and reliability of each result.
4. Synthesize the insights into an evolving report or set of recommendations, using
   LLM-driven summarization and critique at each step.

### Strengths

Capability
:   It can handle high-complexity, multistage investigations that lean on
    specialized databases and cross-disciplinary sources.

Adaptive
:   Research direction is adjusted as new evidence emerges.

Transparent
:   Explicit plans and decomposition steps make it easier to audit methodology.

### Weaknesses

High cost
:   Extensive foundation model use and multiple API calls inflate compute and token
    expenses.

Latency
:   Each layer of planning, decomposition, and reflection adds delay.

Fragility
:   It is reliant on quality and availability of external data sources and needs
    careful error handling and fallback strategies.

The best use cases are long-form, expert-level tasks—academic literature
surveys, technical due diligence, competitive intelligence—where depth and rigor
trump speed.

[Table 5-1](#chapter_5_table_1_1754586822712202) offers a snapshot of today’s
most common agent archetypes—each with its own trade-offs in speed, flexibility,
and complexity. However, this landscape is evolving at breakneck speed. New
hybrid patterns, metareasoning frameworks, and planning strategies are emerging
all the time, and the classification of agent types will only grow more nuanced.
Consider this list a starting point rather than a definitive taxonomy: as the
field advances, you’ll see fresh approaches built on these foundations, so stay
curious, experiment often, and be ready to adapt your orchestration strategies
as the research and tooling continue to mature.

Table 5-1. Common agent archetypes

| Agent type | Strength | Weakness | Best use case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reflex | Millisecond responses | No multistep reasoning | Keyword routing, simple lookups |
| ReAct | Flexible, on-the-fly adaptation | Higher latency and cost | Exploratory workflows, troubleshooting |
| Plan-execute | Clear task breakdown | Planning overhead | Complex, multistep processes |
| Query-decomposition | Grounded retrieval accuracy | Multiple tool calls | Research, fact-based Q&A |
| Reflection | Early error detection | Added compute and latency | High-stakes, safety-critical tasks |
| Deep research | Management of multistage, adaptive investigations | High compute costs and very high latency | Long-form literature reviews |

# Tool Selection

Before we get to orchestration, we will start with tool selection, because it is
the foundation for more advanced planning. Different approaches to tool
selection offer unique advantages and considerations, meeting different
requirements and environments. We assume a set of tools have already been
developed, so if you need a refresher, go back to
[Chapter 4](ch04.html#chapter_4_tool_use_1754586821166039).

Table 5-2. Tool selection strategies

| Technique | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standard tool selection | Simple to implement | Scales poorly to high numbers of tools |
| Semantic tool selection | * Very scalable to large numbers of tools * Typically low latency to implement | Often worse selection accuracy due to semantic collisions |
| Hierarchical tool selection | Very scalable to large numbers of tools | Slower because it requires multiple sequential foundation model calls |

## Standard Tool Selection

The simplest approach is standard tool selection. In this case, the tool, its
definition, and its description are provided to a foundation model, and the
model is asked to select the most appropriate tool for the given context. The
output from the foundation model is then compared with the toolset, and the
closest one is chosen. This approach is easy to implement, and requires no
additional training, embedding, or a toolset hierarchy to use. The main drawback
is latency, as it requires another foundation model call, which can add seconds
to the overall response time. It can also benefit from in-context learning,
where few-shot examples can be provided to boost predictive accuracy for your
problem without the challenge of training or fine-tuning a model.

Effective tool selection often comes down to how you describe each capability.
Start by giving every tool a concise, descriptive name (e.g., `calculate_sum`
instead of `process_numbers`) and follow it with a one-sentence summary that
highlights its unique purpose (e.g., “Returns the sum of two numbers”). Include
an example invocation in the description—showing typical inputs and outputs—to
ground the model’s understanding in concrete terms rather than abstract
language. Finally, enforce input constraints by specifying types and ranges
(e.g., “x and y must be integers between 0 and 1,000”), which reduces ambiguous
matches and helps the foundation model rule out irrelevant tools. By iteratively
testing with representative prompts and refining each description for clarity
and specificity, you’ll see significant gains in selection accuracy without any
extra training or infrastructure. This sounds simple enough, but as the number
of tools you register with your agent grows, overlap in the tool descriptions
frequently becomes a problem and a source of mistakes in tool selection. Here we
define another tool that is capable of computing mathematical expressions and
evaluating formulas, something foundation models tend to not be good at:

```
from langchain_core.tools import tool 
import requests

@tool 
def query_wolfram_alpha(expression: str) -> str: 
    """
    Query Wolfram Alpha to compute expressions or retrieve information. 
    Args: expression (str): The mathematical expression or query to evaluate. 
    Returns: str: The result of the computation or the retrieved information. 
        """

    api_url = f'''https://api.wolframalpha.com/v1/result?
        i={requests.utils.quote(expression)}&
        appid=YOUR_WOLFRAM_ALPHA_APP_ID'''  

    try:
        response = requests.get(api_url)
        if response.status_code == 200: 
            return response.text 
        else: raise ValueError(f"Wolfram Alpha API Error: 
            {response.status_code} - {response.text}") 
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e: 
        raise ValueError(f"Failed to query Wolfram Alpha: {e}")


@tool 
def trigger_zapier_webhook(zap_id: str, payload: dict) -> str: 
    """ Trigger a Zapier webhook to execute a predefined Zap. 
    Args: 
    zap_id (str): The unique identifier for the Zap to be triggered. 
    payload (dict): The data to send to the Zapier webhook. 
    Returns: 
    str: Confirmation message upon successful triggering of the Zap. 
    Raises: ValueError: If the API request fails or returns an error. 
    """ 

    zapier_webhook_url = f"https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/{zap_id}/" 
    try: 
        response = requests.post(zapier_webhook_url, json=payload) 
        if response.status_code == 200: 
            return f"Zapier webhook '{zap_id}' successfully triggered." 

        else: 
        raise ValueError(f'''Zapier API Error: {response.status_code} - 
                         {response.text}''') 
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e: 
        raise ValueError(f"Failed to trigger Zapier webhook '{zap_id}': {e}")
```

Here’s another example of a tool you might want to register with your agent to
notify a particular channel when your task is completed or needs attention for a
human-in-the-loop pattern:

```
@tool 
def send_slack_message(channel: str, message: str) -> str: 
    """ Send a message to a specified Slack channel. 
    Args: 
    channel (str): The Slack channel ID or name where the message will be sent. 
    message (str): The content of the message to send. 
    Returns: 
    str: Confirmation message upon successful sending of the Slack message. 
    Raises: ValueError: If the API request fails or returns an error. 
    """ 

    api_url = "https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage" 
        headers = { "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN",
                    "Content-Type": "application/json" } 
    payload = { "channel": channel, "text": message } 
    try: 
        response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, json=payload) 
        response_data = response.json() 
        if response.status_code == 200 and response_data.get("ok"): 
            return f"Message successfully sent to Slack channel '{channel}'." 
        else: 
            error_msg = response_data.get("error", "Unknown error") 
            raise ValueError(f"Slack API Error: {error_msg}") 
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e: 
            raise ValueError(f'''Failed to send message to Slack channel 
                             "{channel}": {e}''')
```

Now that we’ve defined our tools, we bind them to the model client and allow the
model to pick which tools to invoke to best address the input:

```
# Initialize the LLM with GPT-4o and bind the tools
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4o")
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools([get_stock_price, 
    send_slack_message, query_wolfram_alpha])

messages = [HumanMessage("What is the stock price of Apple?")]

ai_msg = llm_with_tools.invoke(messages)
messages.append(ai_msg)

for tool_call in ai_msg.tool_calls:
   tool_msg = get_stock_price.invoke(tool_call)

final_response = llm_with_tools.invoke(messages)
print(final_response.content)
```

In summary, standard tool selection offers a fast, intuitive way to integrate
tools into your agent system without additional infrastructure or training
overhead. While it scales well for small toolsets, careful description
engineering becomes essential as your tool library grows to maintain accuracy
and avoid misselection. By combining thoughtful descriptions with iterative
prompt testing, you can achieve robust performance using this simple yet
powerful approach.

## Semantic Tool Selection

Another approach, semantic tool selection, uses semantic representations to
index all of the available tools and semantic search to retrieve the most
relevant tools. This reduces the number of tools to choose from and then relies
on the foundation model to choose the correct tool and parameters from this much
smaller set. Ahead of time, each tool definition and description is embedded
using an encoder-only model—such as OpenAI’s Ada model, Amazon’s Titan model,
Cohere’s Embed model, ModernBERT, or others—which represents the tool name and
description as a vector of numbers. This process is illustrated in
[Figure 5-2](#chapter_5_figure_2_1754586822709729), which shows how each tool is
embedded into a vector representation for efficient retrieval based on semantic
similarity to the task query.

![](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098176495/files/assets/bawa_0502.png)

###### Figure 5-2. Semantic tool embedding for retrieval-based selection. Each tool or skill is encoded into a dense vector representation using an embedding model. These vectors are then stored for efficient semantic search, enabling the system to retrieve the most relevant tools based on the task query.

These tools are then indexed in a lightweight vector database. At runtime, the
current context is embedded using the same embedding model, a search is
performed on the database, and the top tools are selected and retrieved. These
tools are then passed to the foundation model, which can then choose to invoke a
tool and choose the parameters. The tool is then invoked, and the response is
used to compose the response for the user. This process is illustrated in
[Figure 5-3](#chapter_5_figure_3_1754586822709750), which shows how the system
retrieves relevant tools and uses the foundation model to select and invoke the
appropriate tool with its parameters to generate the final response.

![](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098176495/files/assets/bawa_0503.png)

###### Figure 5-3. Semantic tool retrieval and invocation workflow. At runtime, the user query is embedded and used to retrieve the top relevant tools from the vector database. The foundation model then selects the appropriate tool and determines its parameters, invokes the tool, and integrates the tool’s output to generate the final user response.

This is the most common pattern and is recommended for most use cases. It’s
typically faster than standard tool selection, performant, and reasonably
scalable. First, the tool database is set up by embedding the tool descriptions:

```
import os
import requests
import logging
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage, ToolMessage
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Initialize OpenAI embeddings
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)

# Tool descriptions
tool_descriptions = {
       "query_wolfram_alpha": '''Use Wolfram Alpha to compute mathematical  
                                 expressions or retrieve information.''',
       "trigger_zapier_webhook": '''Trigger a Zapier webhook to execute  
                                    predefined automated workflows.''',
       "send_slack_message": '''Send messages to specific Slack channels to 
                                communicate with team members.'''
}

# Create embeddings for each tool description
tool_embeddings = []
tool_names = []

for tool_name, description in tool_descriptions.items():
   embedding = embeddings.embed_text(description)
   tool_embeddings.append(embedding)
   tool_names.append(tool_name)

# Initialize FAISS vector store
dimension = len(tool_embeddings[0])  
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)

# Normalize embeddings for cosine similarity
faiss.normalize_L2(np.array(tool_embeddings).astype('float32'))

# Convert list to FAISS-compatible format
tool_embeddings_np = np.array(tool_embeddings).astype('float32')
index.add(tool_embeddings_np)

# Map index to tool functions
index_to_tool = {
   0: query_wolfram_alpha,
   1: trigger_zapier_webhook,
   2: send_slack_message
}
```

Those embeddings for your tool catalog only need to be computed once, and now
they’re ready to be quickly retrieved. To choose your tool, you embed your query
using the same embedding model, perform a quick database lookup, choose the
parameters, and invoke our tool:

```
def select_tool(query: str, top_k: int = 1) -> list:
   """
   Select the most relevant tool(s) based on the user's query using 
   vector-based retrieval.
  
   Args:
       query (str): The user's input query.
       top_k (int): Number of top tools to retrieve.
      
   Returns:
       list: List of selected tool functions.
   """
   query_embedding = embeddings.embed_text(query).astype('float32')
   faiss.normalize_L2(query_embedding.reshape(1, -1))
   D, I = index.search(query_embedding.reshape(1, -1), top_k)
   selected_tools = [index_to_tool[idx] for idx in I[0] if idx in index_to_tool]
   return selected_tools

def determine_parameters(query: str, tool_name: str) -> dict:
   """
   Use the LLM to analyze the query and determine the parameters for the tool 
   to be invoked.
  
   Args:
       query (str): The user's input query.

   Returns:
       dict: Parameters for the tool.
   """
   messages = [
       HumanMessage(content=f'''Based on the user's query: '{query}', what 
           parameters should be used for the tool '{tool_name}'?''')
   ]
  
   # Call the LLM to extract parameters
   response = llm(messages)
  
   # Example logic to parse response from LLM
   parameters = {}
   if tool_name == "query_wolfram_alpha":
       parameters["expression"] = response['expression']  
       # Extract mathematical expression
   elif tool_name == "trigger_zapier_webhook":
       parameters["zap_id"] = response.get('zap_id', "123456")  
       parameters["payload"] = response.get('payload', {"data": query})
   elif tool_name == "send_slack_message":
       parameters["channel"] = response.get('channel', "#general")
       parameters["message"] = response.get('message', query)
  
   return parameters

# Example user query
user_query = "Solve this equation: 2x + 3 = 7"

# Select the top tool
selected_tools = select_tool(user_query, top_k=1)
tool_name = selected_tools[0] if selected_tools else None

if tool_name:
   # Use LLM to determine the parameters based on the query and the selected tool
   args = determine_parameters(user_query, tool_name)

   # Invoke the selected tool
   try:
       # Assuming each tool has an `invoke` method to execute it
       tool_result = globals()[tool_name].invoke(args)
       print(f"Tool '{tool_name}' Result: {tool_result}")
   except ValueError as e:
       print(f"Error invoking tool '{tool_name}': {e}")
else:
   print("No tool was selected.")
```

## Hierarchical Tool Selection

If your scenario involves a large number of tools, however, you might need to
consider hierarchical tool selection. This is especially true if many of those
tools are semantically similar and you are looking to improve tool selection
accuracy at the price of higher latency and complexity. In this pattern, you
organize your tools into groups and provide a description for each group. Your
tool selection (either generative or semantic) first selects a group and then
performs a secondary search only among the tools in that group.
[Figure 5-4](#chapter_5_figure_4_1754586822709767) visualizes this two-stage
process, showing how a query is first routed to the appropriate tool group and
then refined to a single tool within that group.

![](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098176495/files/assets/bawa_0504.png)

###### Figure 5-4. Hierarchical tool-selection workflow. The agent first chooses the most relevant tool group for the query, and then narrows the search to select a single tool within that group—in this example, routing a math question through the tool group and ultimately invoking `query_wolfram_alpha`.

While this is slower and would be expensive to parallelize, it reduces the
complexity of the tool selection task into two smaller chunks, and frequently
results in higher overall tool selection accuracy. Crafting and maintaining
these tool groups takes time and effort, so this is not recommended unless you
have a large number of tools:

```
import os
import requests
import logging
import numpy as np
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage, ToolMessage

# Initialize the LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4", temperature=0)

# Define tool groups with descriptions
tool_groups = {
    "Computation": {
        "description": '''Tools related to mathematical computations and 
                          data analysis.''',

    },

                          different services.''',

        "tools": []
    }

# Tool Execution

Parametrization is the process of defining and setting the parameters that will
guide the execution of a tool in a language model. This process is crucial, as
it determines how the model interprets the task and tailors its response to meet
the specific requirements. Parameters are defined by the tool definition, as
discussed in more detail in
[Chapter 4](ch04.html#chapter_4_tool_use_1754586821166039). The current state of
the agent, including progress so far, is included as additional context in the
prompt window, and the foundation model is instructed to fill the parameters
with appropriate data types to match the expected inputs for the function call.
Additional context, such as the current time or the user’s location, can be
injected into the context window to provide additional guidance for functions
that require this type of information. It is recommended to use a basic parser
to validate that the inputs meet the basic criteria for the data types, and to
instruct the foundation model to correct the pattern if it does not pass this
check.

Once the parameters are set, the tool execution phase begins. Some of these
tools can easily be executed locally, while others will be executed remotely by
API. During execution, the model might interact with various APIs, databases, or
other tools to gather information, perform calculations, or execute actions that
are necessary to complete the task. The integration of external data sources and
tools can significantly enhance the utility and accuracy of the agent’s outputs.
Timeout and retry logic will need to be adjusted to the latency and performance
requirements for the use case.

# Tool Topologies

Today, the majority of chatbot systems rely on single tool execution without
planning. This makes sense: it is easier to implement, and has lower latency. If
your team is developing its first agent-based system, or if that is sufficient
to meet the needs for your scenario, then you can stop there after the following
section, “Single Tool Execution.” For many cases, however, we want our agents to
be able to perform complex tasks that require multiple tools. By providing an
agent with a sufficient range of tools, you can then enable your agent to
flexibly arrange those tools and apply them in correct order to solve a wider
variety of problems. In traditional software engineering, the designers had to
implement the exact control flow and order in which steps should be taken. Now,
we can implement the tools and define the tools topology in which the agent can
operate, and then allow the exact composition to be designed dynamically in
response to the context and task at hand. This section considers this range of
tool topologies and discusses their trade-offs.

## Single Tool Execution

We’ll begin with tasks that require precisely one tool. In this case, planning
consists of choosing the one tool most appropriate to address the task. Once the
tool is selected, it must be correctly parameterized based on the tool
definition. The tool is then executed, and its output is used as an input when
composing the final response for the user, which can be seen in
[Figure 5-5](#chapter_5_figure_5_1754586822709783). While this is a minimal
definition of a plan, it is the foundation from which we will build more complex
patterns.

![](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098176495/files/assets/bawa_0505.png)

###### Figure 5-5. Single tool execution workflow. The user query is passed to the model (step 1), which selects the appropriate tool from the toolset (step 2), receives the tool output (step 3), and composes the final response for the user (step 4).

To make this example more concrete,
[Figure 5-6](#chapter_5_figure_6_1754586822709797) shows this same single tool
execution workflow where the agent retrieves and returns the current weather for
New York City.

![](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098176495/files/assets/bawa_0506.png)

###### Figure 5-6. Example of single tool execution for weather retrieval. The user asks for the weather in New York City, the model selects and parameterizes the weather tool, retrieves the temperature and conditions as a JSON payload, and composes a natural language response using this information for the user.

While this single tool execution pattern is simple, it forms the foundation upon
which more complex multistep planning and tool orchestration strategies are
built in advanced agent systems. In the next section, we’ll look at how we can
execute more tools without sacrificing latency.

## Parallel Tool Execution

The first increase in complexity comes with tool parallelism. In some cases, it
might be worth taking multiple actions on the input. For example, imagine that
you need to look up a record for a patient. If your toolset includes multiple
tools that access multiple sources of data, then it will be necessary to execute
multiple actions to retrieve data from each of the sources. This increases the
complexity of the problem because it is unclear how many tools need to be
executed. A common approach is to retrieve a maximum number of tools that might
be executed—say, five—using semantic tool selection. Next, make a second call to
a foundation model with each of these five tools, and ask it to select the five
or fewer tools that are necessary to the problem, filtering down to the tools
necessary for the task. Similarly, the foundation model can be called repeatedly
with the additional context of which tools have already been selected until it
chooses to add no more tools. Once selected, these tools are independently
parameterized and executed. After all tools have been completed, their results
are passed to the foundation model to draft a final response for the user.
[Figure 5-7](#chapter_5_figure_7_1754586822709816) illustrates this pattern.

![](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098176495/files/assets/bawa_0507.png)

###### Figure 5-7. Parallel tool execution pattern. In this example, the user asks how to handle a customer ticket. The orchestration process selects multiple tools to run in parallel—such as retrieving customer details, order history, service logs, similar tickets, and relevant support policies—before integrating their outputs to generate the final response.

This pattern of parallel tool execution enables agents to efficiently gather
comprehensive information from multiple sources in a single step. By integrating
these results before composing a response, the agent can provide richer, more
informed outputs while minimizing overall latency.

## Chains

The next increase in complexity brings us to chains. Chains refer to sequences
of actions that are executed one after another, with each action depending on
the successful completion of the previous one. Planning chains involves
determining the order in which actions should be performed to achieve a specific
goal while ensuring that each action leads to the next without interruption.
Chains are common in tasks that involve step-by-step processes or linear
workflows.

Fortunately, LangChain offers a declarative syntax, the LangChain Expression
Language (LCEL), to build chains by composing existing Runnables rather than
manually wiring up `Chain` objects. Under the hood, LCEL treats every chain as a
Runnable implementing the same interface, so you can `invoke()`, `batch()`, or
`stream()` any LCEL chain just like any other Runnable:

```
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
# Wrap a function or model call as a Runnable
llm = RunnableLambda.from_callable(ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4", 
                                  temperature=0).generate)
prompt = RunnableLambda.from_callable(lambda text: 
    PromptTemplate.from_template(text).format_prompt({"input": text}
                                      ).to_messages())
# Traditional chain equivalent:
# chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)
# LCEL chain using pipes:
chain = prompt | llm
# Invoke the chain
result = chain.invoke("What is the capital of France?")
```

By switching to LCEL, you reduce boilerplate, gain advanced execution features,
and keep your chains concise and maintainable.
[Figure 5-8](#chapter_5_figure_8_1754586822709831) illustrates the general
agentic chain pattern that underlies many LCEL workflows.

![](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098176495/files/assets/bawa_0508.png)

###### Figure 5-8. Agentic chain execution pattern. The user prompt is passed to the model, which performs reasoning and invokes tools to interact with the environment. The resulting observations are looped back into the model for further reasoning until the task is complete.

The planning of chains requires careful consideration of the dependencies
between actions, aiming to orchestrate a coherent flow of activity toward the
desired outcome. It is highly recommended that a maximum length be set to the
tool chains, as errors can compound down the length of the chain. As long as the
task is not expected to fan out to multiple branching subtasks, chains provide
an excellent trade-off between adding planning for multiple tools with
dependencies and keeping the complexity relatively low.

## Graphs

For support scenarios with multiple decision points, a graph topology models
complex, nonhierarchical flows far more expressively than chains or trees.
Unlike linear chains or strictly branching trees, graph structures let you
define both conditional edges *and* consolidation edges, so that parallel paths
can merge back into shared nodes.

Each node in a graph represents a discrete tool invocation (or logical step),
while edges—including `add_conditional_edges`—declare the exact conditions under
which the agent may transition between steps. By consolidating outputs from
multiple branches into a single downstream node (e.g., `summarize_response`),
you can stitch together findings from separate handlers into a unified customer
reply.

However, full graph execution typically incurs significantly more foundation
model calls than chains—adding latency and cost—so it’s crucial to cap depth and
branching factor. In addition, cycles, unreachable nodes, or conflicting state
merges introduce new classes of errors that must be managed through rigorous
validation and testing. The following is an example for how to implement a graph
in LangGraph:

```
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

# Initialize LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4", temperature=0)
# 1. Node definitions
def categorize_issue(state: dict) -> dict:
    prompt = (
        f"Classify this support request as 'billing' or 'technical'.\n\n"
        f"Message: {state['user_message']}"
    )
    generations = llm.generate([{"role":"user","content":prompt}]).generations
    kind = generations[0][0].text.strip().lower()
    return {**state, "issue_type": kind}
def handle_invoice(state: dict) -> dict:
    # Fetch invoice details...
    return {**state, "step_result": f"Invoice details for {state['user_id']}"}
def handle_refund(state: dict) -> dict:
    # Initiate refund workflow...
    return {**state, "step_result": "Refund process initiated"}
def handle_login(state: dict) -> dict:
    # Troubleshoot login...
    return {**state, "step_result": "Password reset link sent"}
def handle_performance(state: dict) -> dict:
    # Check performance metrics...
    return {**state, "step_result": "Performance metrics analyzed"}
def summarize_response(state: dict) -> dict:
    # Consolidate previous step_result into a user-facing message
    details = state.get("step_result", "")
    summary = llm.generate([{"role":"user","content":
        f"Write a concise customer reply based on: {details}"
    }]).generations[0][0].text.strip()
    return {**state, "response": summary}
```

This next section wires up the logical flow in each node into an actual
execution graph. By creating a new `StateGraph`, we establish the starting point
with START → `categorize_issue`, which ensures every request first passes
through the classification step. Then, using `add_conditional_edges`, you encode
the core business rules: after categorization, only billing issues route into
the invoice/refund handlers, and only technical issues route into the
login/performance handlers. Each router function inspects the evolving state and
returns the name of the next node, and the mapping ensures that only valid
successors are enabled at runtime. This approach keeps the decision logic
explicit, enforces the correct sequence of tool invocations, and prevents
invalid transitions—all before we ever execute a single tool call:

```
# 2. Build the graph
graph = StateGraph()
# Start → categorize_issue
graph.add_edge(START, categorize_issue)
# categorize_issue → billing or technical
def top_router(state):
    return "billing" if state["issue_type"] == "billing" else "technical"
graph.add_conditional_edges(
    categorize_issue,
    top_router,
    mapping={"billing": handle_invoice, "technical": handle_login}
)
# Billing sub-branches: invoice vs. refund
def billing_router(state):
    msg = state["user_message"].lower()
    return "invoice" if "invoice" in msg else "refund"
graph.add_conditional_edges(
    handle_invoice,
    billing_router,
    mapping={"invoice": handle_invoice, "refund": handle_refund}
)
# Technical sub-branches: login vs. performance
def tech_router(state):
    msg = state["user_message"].lower()
    return "login" if "login" in msg else "performance"
graph.add_conditional_edges(
    handle_login,
    tech_router,
    mapping={"login": handle_login, "performance": handle_performance}
)
```

This final wiring adds consolidation edges so that, no matter which subpath was
taken—whether the user needed an invoice lookup, a refund, login
troubleshooting, or performance checks—their result feeds into the single
`summarize_response` node. By connecting each of the handler nodes
(`handle_refund`, `handle_performance`, `handle_invoice`, and `handle_login`)
into `summarize_response`, you ensure all divergent outcomes are unified into
one coherent customer reply. Finally, linking `summarize_response` to `END`
cleanly terminates the workflow, guaranteeing every execution path converges on
a polished response before the graph finishes:

```
# Consolidation: both refund and performance (and invoice/login) lead here
graph.add_edge(handle_refund, summarize_response)
graph.add_edge(handle_performance, summarize_response)
# Also cover paths where invoice or login directly go to summary
graph.add_edge(handle_invoice, summarize_response)
graph.add_edge(handle_login, summarize_response)
# Final: summary → END
graph.add_edge(summarize_response, END)
# 3. Execute the graph
initial_state = {
    "user_message": "Hi, I need help with my invoice and possibly a refund.",
    "user_id": "U1234"
}
result = graph.run(initial_state, max_depth=5)
print(result["response"])
```

Graphs offer the ultimate flexibility for modeling complex, nonlinear
workflows—enabling you to branch, merge, and consolidate multiple tool
executions into a unified process. However, this expressiveness comes with added
overhead: more LLM calls, deeper routing logic, and the potential for cycles or
unreachable paths. To harness graphs effectively, always anchor your design in
your specific use case’s requirements, and resist the temptation to
overcomplicate.

Start with a chain if your task is strictly linear (e.g., prompt → model →
parser). Chains are easy to reason about and debug. Adopt a graph only when you
must both branch and later consolidate multiple streams of information (e.g.,
parallel analysis steps that feed a single summary).

In practice, sketch your topology on paper first: label each node with the tool
or logical step, draw arrows for the allowed transitions, and highlight where
branches reunite. Then implement incrementally—cap your depth and branching
factor, write unit tests for each router, and leverage LangGraph’s built-in
tracing to validate that every path leads to a terminal node.

Above all, keep it as simple as possible. Every additional node or edge
multiplies the potential execution paths and error modes. If a simpler chain or
tree meets your needs, save the graph patterns for genuinely complex scenarios.
By starting simple and iterating only as your requirements demand, you’ll build
robust, maintainable orchestration that scales with confidence.

# Context Engineering

Context engineering is a core component of orchestration. It ensures that each
step in an agent’s plan has the right information and instructions to perform
effectively. While prompt engineering focuses on writing effective instructions,
context engineering involves dynamically assembling all inputs—user messages,
retrieved knowledge, workflow state, and system prompts—into a structured,
token-efficient context window that maximizes task performance. For example,
planner-executor agents depend on clean plan outputs being passed as context to
executor steps, while ReAct agents require relevant tool results embedded
clearly in the prompt to inform their next reasoning cycle. Context engineering
thus bridges planning and execution, enabling agent workflows to remain
coherent, grounded, and aligned with user goals.

At its core, context engineering involves deciding what information to include,
how to structure it for maximum clarity and relevance, and how to fit it
efficiently within token limits. This includes the current user input, relevant
snippets retrieved from memory or external knowledge bases, summaries of prior
conversations, system instructions defining the agent’s role, and any workflow
state necessary for the task at hand. In simple systems, context may consist
only of a system prompt and the latest user query. But as agents tackle more
complex tasks—like orchestrating multistep workflows or personalizing
recommendations based on past interactions—dynamic context construction becomes
critical for maintaining coherence, accuracy, and utility.

For example, an agent handling ecommerce support might construct its context by
combining the system prompt defining its allowed actions, the user’s current
message, a retrieved summary of the order record, and any applicable policy
excerpts. In more advanced systems, the context might also include summaries of
prior related conversations or the results of tool invocations from earlier in
the workflow. Each additional element can improve task performance, but only if
included thoughtfully; irrelevant or poorly structured context risks distracting
the model or exceeding token budgets without benefit.

Effective context engineering requires several core practices. First, prioritize
relevance by retrieving only the most useful information from memory or
knowledge bases, rather than indiscriminately appending large blocks of text.
Second, maintain clarity through structured formatting or schemas such as Model
Context Protocol (MCP), which pass state and retrieved knowledge to the model in
a predictable, interpretable way. Third, use summarization techniques to
compress longer histories into concise representations, preserving critical
details without wasting tokens. Finally, ensure that context is dynamically
assembled at each inference step to reflect the agent’s current objectives,
workflow stage, and user input.

Context engineering sits at the intersection of memory, knowledge, and
orchestration. While orchestration decides what steps to take in a workflow,
context engineering ensures that each step has the right information to execute
effectively. As foundation models continue to improve, the frontier of agentic
system design is shifting from model architecture to the quality of context we
provide. In essence, a well-engineered context unlocks the full potential of
even modest models, while poor context can undermine the performance of the most
advanced systems.

By mastering context engineering, developers can create agents that are not only
technically powerful but also reliable, grounded, and responsive to the needs of
their users and environments. In the coming years, as memory systems, retrieval
architectures, and orchestration frameworks evolve, context engineering will
remain the glue that binds these components into seamless, effective
experiences.

# Conclusion

The success of agents relies heavily on the approach to orchestration, making it
important for organizations interested in building agentic systems to invest
time and energy into designing the appropriate planning strategy for the use
case. Here are some best practices for designing a planning system:

* Carefully consider the requirements for latency and accuracy for your system, as
  there is a clear trade-off between these two factors.
* Determine the typical number of actions required for your scenario’s use case.
  The greater this number, the more complex an approach to planning you are likely
  to need.
* Assess how much the plan needs to change based on the results from prior
  actions. If significant adaptation is necessary, consider a technique that
  allows for incremental plan adjustments.
* Design a representative set of test cases to evaluate different planning
  approaches and identify the best fit for your use case.
* Choose the simplest planning approach that will meet your use case requirements.

With an orchestration approach that will work well for your scenario, we’ll now
move on to the next part of the workflow: memory. It is worth starting small
with well-designed scenarios and simpler approaches to orchestration, and to
then gradually move up the scale of complexity as necessary based on the use
case. In the next chapter, we will explore how memory can further enhance your
agents’ capabilities—enabling them to recall knowledge, maintain context across
interactions, and perform tasks with greater intelligence and personalization.
